Task 2 - Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
This project looks at life expectancy trends worldwide and focuses on Africa to understand what impacts life expectancy in that region. The work is divided into four steps:

1. **Global Life Expectancy Analysis**  
   We start by analyzing life expectancy trends for the entire world.

2. **Focus on Africa**  
   Based on the global analysis, we focus on Africa to study regional trends.

3. **Impact of Factors**  
   We identify and analyze different factors that affect life expectancy in African countries.

4. **Trends of Key Factors**  
   Finally, we look at how these important factors have changed over time in Africa.

## Folder Structure
- **Codes**  
  This folder contains all the scripts for:
  - Data visualization
  - Machine learning (K-means clustering)
  - Data preprocessing

- **Files**  
  This folder contains the dataset and preprocessed files.

- **Images**  
  This folder contains images used in the report, as well as some extra images.

## How to Run the Code
1. Download all the files, including the notebooks from the `Codes` folder, into one folder.  
2. Ensure all files and notebooks are in the same folder.  
3. Open and run the notebooks in order.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `re`
