# Task 2 - Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
We focus on life expectancy trends. cWe have 4 rounds in this workflow. 

1. *First Run**  
   We start by analyzing life expectancy trends for the entire world.

2. **Second Run**  
   Based on the feedback of first run , we focus on Africa to study regional trends.
